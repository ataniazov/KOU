7 Segment Display Driver
=====================================

## What is Logisim ?

See at the Project page: http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/

## How to use ?

### Step 1


First of all you will need to download the this project (link),  or clone 


Then create a new circuit pressing "CTRL + N".

See:

### Step 2

Right click at your circuit folder, go to "Load Library" > "Logisim Library" then find the "7-segment-display-drive.circ" file

### Step 3

After loading the library, you need to add the component to your circuit.

It's easy to see down in the list, the component:

### Step 4

Make your circuit, and remember the display pins are:

So, after connecting the Driver to the display, your circuit should look like this:
